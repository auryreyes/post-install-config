<h3>Step 6. Configure Users (Customers)</h3>

Users can now register for an account and log in to generate tickets or check the status of existing tickets. Either the Agent Panel or the Admin Panel can be used to add users. In this case, two users were established via the Agent Panel.

**Add Users**
- Agent Panel -> Users -> Add New
  - Karen
  - Ken

<h3>Step 7. Configure Service Level Agreement (SLAs)</h3>

The SLA Plan's goal is to specify how long the help desk administrator anticipates it will take to resolve tickets.

**Add Service Level Agreement (SLAs)**
- Admin Panel -> Manage -> SLA
  - Sev-A (1 hour, 24/7)
  - Sev-B (4 hours, 24/7)
  - Sev-C (8 hours, business hours Mon - Fri 8am-5pm with U.S. Holidays)

**Add Help Topics**
